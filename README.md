## Overview
This web app can give you the coordination of a searched place and a picture of the place map, mainly cities. the problem domain was to help people identify places on click.
## Getting Started

1. Write down a plan for the workflow.
2. create a new React app.
3. code the initial components. 
4. pass the interchangeable data through state.
5. search for an api that supports your project and retrieve data from it.
